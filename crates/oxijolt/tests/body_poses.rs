//! Same-machine determinism of [`PhysicsWorld::active_body_poses`]: the poses of the awake
//! bodies, in the order the call returns them, must be bit-identical whether the world steps
//! with 1 or 4 worker threads or on a caller job system.
//!
//! The "wake" scene puts a sleeping 8 x 8 x 3 grid of small cubes on a floor and drops four
//! spheres onto it. The spheres wake the cubes they hit and the cubes wake their neighbours, from
//! several jobs at once, so Jolt's own active list fills in a thread-dependent order; later the
//! grid falls asleep again. Every tick records the returned ids and poses, and checks them
//! against the per-body readout.
//!
//! Each run happens in its own child process (this test binary, running the ignored
//! `body_poses_child` test), so no state leaks between runs; see `common::determinism`.
