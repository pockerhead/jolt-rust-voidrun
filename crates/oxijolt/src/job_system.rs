/// ([`WorldSettings::worker_threads`](crate::WorldSettings::worker_threads)).
///
/// A step splits its work into jobs, small closures with dependencies. The thread that calls
/// [`PhysicsWorld::step`](crate::PhysicsWorld::step) waits for them at a Jolt barrier, and while
/// it waits it runs the jobs that no other thread has started. A step therefore finishes even
/// when the pool runs a job late or never; a job the stepping thread already ran does nothing
/// when the pool runs it.
///
/// A job that is run or dropped while [`queue_job`](Self::queue_job) is on the same thread's
/// stack is not started there, because Jolt does not let a job start inside another job on one
/// thread; it is left to the stepping thread, and the step hands it back to Jolt after the
