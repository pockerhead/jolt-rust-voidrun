/// [`PhysicsWorld::restore_state`].
///
/// It holds Jolt's saved state of the physics system (bodies with their poses, velocities,
/// forces and sleep data, soft body vertices, the contact cache, each constraint's own state,
/// vehicles' driver input and drivetrain, tracked vehicles' track speeds and motorcycles' target
/// lean), every character's [`CharacterState`] and the contact-cache invalidations

/// step has applied yet, which a state of some bodies ([`PhysicsWorld::save_state_of`]) holds
/// for every body too.
///
/// A state restores only into the world that saved it, and only while that world's structure is
/// unchanged: creating or removing a body, character, vehicle, ragdoll or constraint, setting a
/// body's or a ragdoll's motion type, setting a body's shape, or a
/// [`rebase`](PhysicsWorld::rebase) that moves anything makes every earlier state unrestorable
/// ([`StateError::WorldChanged`]). Calls that fail their
/// checks keep states restorable.
///
/// Configuration Jolt does not save, such as constraint limits, motor settings, a vehicle's
/// gravity override and soft body vertex inverse masses, stays as it is when a state is
/// restored. So does a vehicle's world up, which a zero gravity keeps from the step before. Jolt
/// does not save a motorcycle's integrated lean angle, which is why its integration coefficient
/// must be 0.
/// [docs/state.md] lists every such setter.
///
/// A state is opaque: it gives neither its bytes nor `==`, because Jolt's stream may hold bytes
/// without a defined value (a wheel's contact data before its first contact). Compare what a
/// world reports instead.

/// For rollback, allocate the states once ([`WorldState::new`]) and save into them with
