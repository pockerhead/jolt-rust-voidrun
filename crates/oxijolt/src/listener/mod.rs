//! Contact, body activation and soft body contact events.
//!
//! A world records nothing until [`PhysicsWorld::set_event_settings`] asks for events. Jolt
//! reports them from its worker threads during [`PhysicsWorld::step`], and from the calling
//! thread when a body is created, woken or removed; the callbacks only copy what Jolt hands
//! them into the world's buffers. After each step, the step's events are sorted into an order
//! that does not depend on the thread count and appended to a queue, which
//! [`PhysicsWorld::take_events`] drains. `docs/events.md` lists the Jolt paths behind each
//! event and what the callbacks may read.

/// in no fixed order, while it holds every body: a method must not touch the world. For a
/// deterministic simulation its decision must depend only on its arguments and on data fixed
/// for the step; a mutex makes shared state safe to use here, not deterministic. Jolt may call
/// [`contact_validate`](Self::contact_validate) any number of times per pair and step; only
/// the added and persisted calls follow the contacts.
///
/// A panic in a method is resumed by `step` after the update. Jolt then keeps its own settings
/// for that contact (or accepts the hit, for a validation), and calls that start after the panic skip the listener until the panic is
/// resumed; calls already running on other threads finish. The step that panicked has advanced
/// the world: it is outside the replay guarantee.
///
/// Settings a method leaves invalid for its contact (a value of another contact assigned over
/// them, see [`ContactSettings`]) are not applied: Jolt keeps its own settings for that
/// contact, the world records a [`ContactSettingsRejection`] in
/// [`WorldEvents::rejected_contact_settings`] and counts it in
