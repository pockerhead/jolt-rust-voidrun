//! The magnitudes the safe API accepts.
//!
//! Jolt checks most magnitudes only with debug assertions (the `asserts` feature) and otherwise
//! computes with whatever it is given, so a finite but huge input can overflow Jolt's `f32`
//! arithmetic inside a step. An input with a magnitude bound is checked against the constants of
//! this module before it reaches Jolt, and a value outside the bound is refused with the error of
//! the call. Other inputs only have to be finite, non-negative or ordered.
//!
//! # Frame and units
//! Positions are in metres in the world frame, which must keep every component of a caller-given
//! position within [`MAX_POSITION`]; [`PhysicsWorld::rebase`] moves the world into a new frame.
//! Shapes and local offsets are in metres around a shape's centre of mass, within
//! [`MAX_SHAPE_EXTENT`]. Velocities are in m/s and rad/s, accelerations in m/s² and rad/s², masses
//! in kg.
//!
//! [`MAX_LINEAR_VELOCITY`] and [`MAX_ANGULAR_VELOCITY`] are Jolt's own defaults. Every other
//! constant is crate policy, chosen from Jolt's documented ranges ("Conventions and Limits", "Big
//! Worlds" in Jolt's `Docs/Architecture.md`) or from the arithmetic it keeps finite.
//!
//! # Further reading
//! - [docs/limits.md] derives each bound from the Jolt arithmetic it protects.
//! - [docs/coverage.md] lists every input with its rule and boundary test, the paths that only
//!   tests cover, and what no bound here excludes.
