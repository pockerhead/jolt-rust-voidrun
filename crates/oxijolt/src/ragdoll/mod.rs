//! Ragdolls: Jolt's `Ragdoll`, a set of bodies joined by constraints, owned by a
//! [`PhysicsWorld`] and created from [`RagdollSettings`].
//!
//! # Ragdolls and worlds
//! A ragdoll's parts are ordinary bodies of the world, listed by [`RagdollRef::body_ids`], that
//! the world destroys only with the ragdoll ([`PhysicsWorld::remove_ragdoll`]). Parts of one
//! ragdoll never collide with each other; parts of different ragdolls do. For ragdolls in a
//! second world next to the main one, create the static bodies of both from the same [`Shape`]
//! handles; Jolt shapes are shared, not copied.
//!
//! For the caller's own (for example radial) gravity, give every part
//! [`gravity_factor(0.0)`](crate::BodySettings::gravity_factor) and add `g * mass` to each part
//! every tick ([`BodyRef::mass`](crate::BodyRef::mass), [`BodyMut::add_force`](crate::BodyMut::add_force)).
