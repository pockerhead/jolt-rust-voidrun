//! Query filters: which bodies and compound children a scene query considers.
//!
//! joltc's object-layer, body and shape filters call one process-global proc table per filter
//! type (`JPH_*Filter_SetProcs`). oxijolt installs its tables once and never changes them;
//! everything that differs between queries travels in the filters' `userData`, which points to
//! a [`FilterState`] on the stack of the running query. joltc runs a narrow-phase query and
//! every callback synchronously on the calling thread (no job system is involved), so that
//! state lives exactly as long as the callbacks can see it.
