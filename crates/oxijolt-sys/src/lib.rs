//! Unsafe bindings to [Jolt Physics] 5.6.0 through the [joltc] C wrapper.
//!
//! Everything here is `bindgen` output over joltc's `include/joltc.h` plus this
//! fork's `native/joltc_ext/joltc_ext.h`, and keeps their `JPH_*` names. The output is
//! committed under `src/bindings/`, one file per ABI family and configuration, so building
//! needs no libclang; the `bindgen` feature generates it at build time instead. The
//! supported targets are the registry in `build/targets.rs`; 32-bit targets are not
//! supported. The
//! extension adds functions in joltc's naming that are compiled into the joltc
//! archive: a `JPH_StateRecorder`, `JPH_CharacterVirtual_SaveState` and
//! `RestoreState`, `JPH_CharacterVirtual_ExtendedUpdate2` and
//! `RefreshContacts2` with explicit gravity, filters and temp allocator,
//! `JPH_VehicleConstraint_AsConstraint`, the `Constraint` base of a vehicle
//! constraint, and for ragdolls `JPH_RagdollSettings_SetPart`, the typed
//! `JPH_RagdollSettings_SetPartToParentSwingTwist`, `_SetPartToParentHinge` and
//! `_SetPartToParentSixDOF`, `JPH_RagdollSettings_CalculateConstraintPriorities`,
//! the swing-twist motor states (`JPH_SwingTwistConstraint_SetSwingMotorState`,
//! `_GetSwingMotorState`, `_SetTwistMotorState`, `_GetTwistMotorState`), its
//! `SetTargetOrientationBS` and `GetRotationInConstraintSpace`, and
//! `JPH_HingeConstraint_SetTargetOrientationBS`, and materials with user data
//! (`JPH_PhysicsMaterial_Create2`, `JPH_PhysicsMaterial_GetUserData`,
//! `JPH_ConvexShapeSettings_SetMaterial`, `JPH_HeightFieldShapeSettings_Create2`), the
//! sub-shape pair of a removed contact (`JPH_SubShapeIDPair_GetBody1ID` and its three siblings)
//! and a soft body contact listener (`JPH_SoftBodyContactListener_*`,
//! `JPH_PhysicsSystem_SetSoftBodyContactListener`, `JPH_SoftBodyManifold_*`). The safe API lives
//! in the `oxijolt` crate.
//!
//! # Features
//! - `asserts`: compile Jolt with its debug assertions. joltc's default handler prints a failed
//!   assertion and then executes a breakpoint (`__debugbreak` on MSVC), so raw users should
//!   install their own with `JPH_SetAssertFailureHandler` before `JPH_Init`. The handler is one
//!   process-global joltc slot, and the `oxijolt` crate installs its own.
//! - `double-precision`: world positions ([`Real`], `JPH_RVec3`, `JPH_RMat4`) use `f64`.
//! - `cross-platform-deterministic`: build Jolt with its cross-platform deterministic
//!   floating point settings (slower; same results across compilers and platforms).
//! - `debug-renderer`: compile Jolt's debug renderer into the native libraries and bind joltc's
//!   debug drawing functions.
//! - `bindgen`: generate the bindings at build time with libclang instead of using the
//!   committed ones. It does not add supported targets.
//!
//! # Native build and `JOLTC_LIB_DIR`
//! By default the build script builds joltc and Jolt from the `vendor/` submodules with
//! CMake, always in Release. Set `JOLTC_LIB_DIR` to an install prefix produced by an
//! earlier build (`OUT_DIR/joltc`) to skip CMake: it holds `lib/` with the joltc and Jolt
//! static libraries, `include/joltc.h`, `include/joltc_ext.h` and
//! `oxijolt-sys-manifest.txt`. A prefix is specific
//! to the target, the C runtime, the crate features and the pinned joltc and Jolt
//! commits; the build script validates all of these against the manifest and refuses a
//! mismatch.
//!
//! # Using the raw API
//! joltc's own contract, as observed in its source:
//! - Shape creators such as `JPH_BoxShape_Create` return a shape that holds **one**
//!   reference, and `JPH_Shape_Destroy` releases one. Bodies keep their own reference, so
//!   the creator releases its reference once it no longer needs the shape.
//! - `JPH_PhysicsSystem_Destroy` deletes the broad-phase layer interface and both layer
//!   filters passed in `JPH_PhysicsSystemSettings`. Do not destroy them yourself.
//! - `JPH_Init` is guarded by a plain `bool`, and creating or destroying a physics system
//!   writes an unsynchronised global map. Call `JPH_Init` once, and create and destroy
//!   systems from one thread at a time.
//! - `JPH_PhysicsSystem_Update` uses one global temp allocator. Use
//!   `JPH_PhysicsSystem_Update2` with a per-world `JPH_TempAllocator` instead.
//! - joltc's `JPH_CharacterVirtual_Update`, `ExtendedUpdate`, `RefreshContacts`,
//!   `WalkStairs`, `StickToFloor` and `SetShape` use joltc's one global temp
//!   allocator and are not thread-safe. Use `JPH_CharacterVirtual_ExtendedUpdate2`
//!   and `JPH_CharacterVirtual_RefreshContacts2` with a per-world allocator instead.
//! - `JPH_CharacterVirtualSettings_Init` (and `JPH_CharacterSettings_Init`) create an
//!   empty shape and its settings on every call, each holding a reference nobody
//!   releases. Fill the settings field by field instead.
//! - A recorder passed to `JPH_CharacterVirtual_RestoreState` must hold a complete
//!   stream written by `JPH_CharacterVirtual_SaveState`.
//! - `JPH_JobSystemThreadPool_Create` maps `numThreads <= 0` to "as many as there are
//!   hardware threads", so pass a positive worker count when the count matters.
//! - joltc's object-layer, body and shape filters (`JPH_ObjectLayerFilter_*`,
//!   `JPH_BodyFilter_*`, `JPH_ShapeFilter_*`) call one process-global proc table per filter
//!   type. The `oxijolt` crate installs those tables once and owns them. Code that links
//!   both crates must not call `JPH_*Filter_SetProcs` for these three types, and must not pass
//!   filters it created with `JPH_*Filter_Create` to queries, because the callbacks of
//!   `oxijolt` would receive their `userData`.
//! - joltc's contact and body activation listeners and the extension's soft body contact
//!   listener also call one process-global proc table each. The `oxijolt` crate installs
//!   them once and owns them: code that links both crates must not call
//!   `JPH_ContactListener_SetProcs`, `JPH_BodyActivationListener_SetProcs` or
//!   `JPH_SoftBodyContactListener_SetProcs`, nor create listeners of these types, whose
//!   `userData` the callbacks of `oxijolt` would receive.
//! - A vehicle constraint must be registered both as a constraint
//!   (`JPH_PhysicsSystem_AddConstraint` with `JPH_VehicleConstraint_AsConstraint`) and as a
//!   step listener (`JPH_PhysicsSystem_AddStepListener` with
//!   `JPH_VehicleConstraint_AsPhysicsStepListener`), and its collision tester must be set
//!   before the first step. Remove it from both before its last reference is released
//!   (`JPH_Constraint_Destroy` on the `AsConstraint` pointer) and before its body is
//!   destroyed.
//! - `JPH_VehicleEngineSettings_Init` allocates a `JPH_LinearCurve` for `normalizedTorque`
//!   that the caller must destroy with `JPH_LinearCurve_Destroy`.
//! - The `JPH_Wheel_GetContact*` getters are meaningful only while `JPH_Wheel_HasContact`
//!   returns true.
//! - `JPH_RagdollSettings_CreateRagdoll` dereferences null when the world cannot hold every
//!   part. Check `JPH_PhysicsSystem_GetNumBodies() + parts <= JPH_PhysicsSystem_GetMaxBodies()`
//!   first, with no body created concurrently. The skeleton must list parents before their
//!   children.
//! - A ragdoll destroys its bodies through its physics system when its last reference is
//!   released: remove it from the system (`JPH_Ragdoll_RemoveFromPhysicsSystem`) before that,
//!   and release it before the system is destroyed.
//! - `JPH_Ragdoll_DriveToPoseUsingMotors` drives only swing-twist and hinge parts (any other
//!   constraint is a Jolt assertion) and needs
//!   `JPH_RagdollSettings_CalculateBodyIndexToConstraintIndex` to have run.
//! - `JPH_RagdollSettings_SetPartToParent` handles swing-twist only and drops the constraint
//!   base settings, the spring modes and the motor torque limits; the typed
//!   `JPH_RagdollSettings_SetPartToParent*` functions of the extension keep every field.
//! - A motor state other than `JPH_MotorState_Off` needs valid motor settings (Jolt
//!   `MotorSettings::IsValid`).
//! - These joltc functions are not bound: `JPH_RagdollSettings_DisableParentChildCollisions`,
//!   `JPH_Ragdoll_SetPose2`, `JPH_Ragdoll_GetPose2`, `JPH_SkeletonMapper_Initialize`,
//!   `JPH_SkeletonMapper_LockAllTranslations`, `JPH_SkeletonMapper_LockTranslations`,
//!   `JPH_SkeletonMapper_Map` and `JPH_SkeletonMapper_MapReverse`. They reinterpret a
//!   4-aligned `JPH_Mat4` array as Jolt's 16-aligned `Mat44`, which is undefined
//!   behaviour for most arrays a caller can pass.
//! - The debug drawing functions (`JPH_DebugRenderer_*`, `JPH_BodyDrawFilter_*`,
//!   `JPH_PhysicsSystem_Draw*`, `JPH_Shape_Draw`) exist only with the `debug-renderer` feature,
//!   which also compiles Jolt's debug renderer into the native libraries.
//! - Jolt's `DebugRenderer` is a process singleton and joltc's `JPH_DebugRenderer_SetProcs` sets
//!   one global proc table. With the `debug-renderer` feature of `oxijolt`, that crate
//!   installs the table and creates a renderer during `PhysicsWorld::debug_lines`; code that
//!   links both crates must not call `JPH_DebugRenderer_SetProcs` or keep its own
//!   `JPH_DebugRenderer` alive.
